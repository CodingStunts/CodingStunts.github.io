        <h3>
          This is the front-end element of my Northcoders project phase. It is a
          React site, styled (scantily) with vanilla CSS. It provides the
          interface to present and interact with the API on my back-end server
          <a href="games-server.html">here</a>. It allows you to access filtered
          lists of reviews by several queries, view the users of the review
          site, see associated comments, and you can like and comment on each
          review. It currently uses a pseudo-login for ease as the database has
          a set list of users. Please see the hosted version
          <a href="https://room-with-a-review.netlify.app/" target="_blank"
            >here</a
