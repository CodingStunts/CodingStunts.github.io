      <p>
        I began my journey into coding in January 2021 as I started dabbling
        with HTML and CSS. I made some interesting (read: hideous) basic sites.
        Then in October 2021 I took the plunge, quit my insurance job, and took
        on a 3 month full-stack coding bootcamp. I've since been working towards
        getting started in the tech world, hoping to broaden and deepen my
        skills in this exciting new industry.
