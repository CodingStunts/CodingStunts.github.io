            I began my journey into coding in January 2021 as I started dabbling
            with HTML and CSS. I made some interesting (read: hideous) basic
            sites. Then in October 2021 I took the plunge, quit my insurance
            job, and took on a 3 month full-stack coding bootcamp. I've since
            been working towards getting started in the tech world, hoping to
            broaden and deepen my skills in this exciting new industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my down time I like mindfulness practices; such as meditation and
            qi gong. I like to keep active, often out cycling, hiking (when
            North Western weather permits), and generally keeping healthy. Some
            major interests include classic literature; especially 19/20th
            century horror, science, world affairs, wildlife, cinema, gaming,
            and trying to stop my plants from dying.

        <p>
          I studied with a 13-week full-stack bootcamp.
          <strong>ReactJS</strong> was the main front-end framework, but I also
          got experience of <strong>React Native</strong>. On the back-end we
          covered <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>PostgresQL</strong>,
          along with other packages like
          <strong
            >Express, dotenv, and testing using Jest and Supertest.</strong
          >
          We also made use of <strong>Firebase</strong> for our final project
          and spiked tech like <strong>Mongoose and Flutter</strong> briefly. I
          am experienced in <strong>TDD and Agile</strong>
          work practices; including kanban and stand-ups. Have worked as a solo
          dev and also have experience of pair programming and as being part of
          a team of developers.
