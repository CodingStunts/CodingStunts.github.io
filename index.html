        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I began my journey into coding in January 2021 as I started dabbling
          with HTML and CSS. I made some interesting (read: hideous) basic
          sites. Then in October 2021 I took the plunge, quit my insurance job,
          and took on a 3 month full-stack coding bootcamp. I've since been
          working towards getting started in the tech world, hoping to broaden
          and deepen my skills in this exciting new industry.

        <h2>What can I do?</h2>
        <p>
          I studied with a 13-week full-stack bootcamp. ReactJS was the main
          front-end framework, but I also got experience of React Native. On the
          back-end we covered Node.js and Postgres, along with other packages
          like Express, dotenv, and testing using Jest and Supertest. We also
          made use of Firebase for our final project and spiked tech like
          Mongoose and Flutter briefly. I am experienced in TDD and Agile work
          practices; including kanban and stand-ups. Have worked as a solo dev
          and also have experience of pair programming as being part of a team
          of developers.
